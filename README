README: 
(edited July 14, 2011)

This is a small program that will take an object file and a source file assosciated 
with it and display some statistics about the source file code transposed into 
assembly language commands. The perl file should be usable out of the box; just run
    chmod +x analyzer.pl 
to add execution permissions, and then you can use it (it has a help output if you run
it with no parameters, or even:
    ./analyzer.pl --help

The BASH script, install.sh is provided for convenience; all is does is append the contents
of the lisp file onto your .emacs configuration file and copy the analyzer script into your 
~/bin directory. You could, of course, do these manually to the same effect.

The emacs default key combination to view assembly source is C-x C-a (Control + x then Control + a).
You can edit the .emacs file and remap the function to your favorite key combination.

I hope you enjoy the little utility,
